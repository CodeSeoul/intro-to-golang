# Intro to Golang

This is the code part of the Golang crash course. It's meant to go along [with the presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11p_0L_lAoojz2O5dfwY4buANHhjvNVhkkxfWK_8ZP-U/edit#slide=id.p). The presentation was also [streamed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAhbPPixG6M).

## Setup
1. Install Go
2. In this directory, run `go mod tidy`

## Running
Each file is meant to be run independently. You can execute each with `go run <file.go>` where `<file.go>` is the name of some Go file.
